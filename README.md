# Welcome to Strife!

## Intro

Shortly after Discord announced their IPO my friend group and I were joking about the fact that we probably had one good year left on the platform before it got terrible.

That led me to think that it would be an interesting project to try to build an alternative to Discord, at least the parts that I use most. I have no idea to what degree I will ever accomplish that but it's a nice goal to shoot for and it gives me a project which I can share publically which is a nice bonus. My pipedream for this project is that it gets enough features that my friends would entertain using it because they could make feature requests directly to the developer. Realistically this probably only gets used by me or an incredibly small group of people but I'm trying to build it to support any user joining and creating their own servers/channels to build a community
